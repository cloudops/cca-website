        <p>While there are many benefits to multi-tenant cloud infrastructure, the cloud.ca team recognizes that this doesn’t solve all customer needs, particularly for certain privacy and security oriented use cases. This is why we offer flexible dedicated infrastructure options.</p>
        <p>Dedicated infrastructure in cloud.ca can be provisioned to meet specific customer requirements, while still providing the benefit of predictable monthly Opex costs.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-lg-5 col-sm-12">
      <p>A number of options are available, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Dedicated compute clusters</li>
        <li>Dedicated storage</li>
        <li>Dedicated networking/security</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Each of these can be deployed seamlessly with complementary cloud.ca multi-tenant infrastructure.</p>
